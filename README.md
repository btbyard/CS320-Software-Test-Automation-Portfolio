CS320 Software Test Automation

This course has been a great one. It was good to brush up on some java again and using classes, java methods, and integreated testing to continue my java practice as a developer. It was good to learn about Junit this term as I had never used that before. It did take some research and some practice to get fluent with using Junit, but I understand the benefits now and I think it is a great way to test your software with Java. 

To ensure that code is fucntional and secure it is very important to testing. I have learned throughout my education that there are many different ways to test software and the choice is potentially up to the developer. Some developers rely on testers to do that work for them, but this term we kind of focused on incorporating testing classes with junit in our code, to test it when it runs. It was cool becuase this style tests the software and we see no differnece in output of the code unless there is an error, which points us in a quick and easy method to fix it. 

It is important to incorporate user needs into a program. In this course we were given requirements by a use. For example, in the code I provided we were requested by user to make a way for user to navigate and edit a contact list via computer. We had to take all the things the requested and begin to think how to make the code acheive those things. When we hear list from the user we think "array" or "array list" and how we can use lists and loops to navigate contacts. It's best to take what is requested from the user, and lay it out in something such as pseudocode and a UML diagram before beginning to write code. 

I approach designing software by first writing pseudocode, and the protential flow of the program. After that a drawign of some type of visual that shows the connections in code and the links between classes helps me understand the flow and inhertiance of classes and such. This also gives you a chance to figure for what variavbles and methods you will need. Once that digaram and modeling is done then code process begins. After and while coding it is important to run and test your code as you code, to ensure a quality product.
